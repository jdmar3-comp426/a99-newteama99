Notes: The full game is meant to have data saving functionality through in the database. The current game get its sudoku board from a hard-coded set of numbers and there are only 3 boards (easy, medium and hard). In the future, we would like to store a large set of sudoku boards and also have a player history for each user with their saved sudoku boards so that they can continue their progress. The game also has the functionality to change the theme (light/dark) and the amount of time allocated for the game. By clicking the digit in the number container on the right and then a cell, the user is able to enter a digit in the cell. Credit has to go to RedFlyer Coding's tutorial for aiding the with the design of the game itself and the javascript functions. Queries exist to fetch and update the boards but backend errors prevented us from finishing the entire game. If we had more time, we would connect the save game functionality to the database and also differentiate the gamefrom the tutorial more.

Instructions: Fill in the spots on this 9x9 grid such that each row has digits 1-9, each column has digits 1-9, and each 3x3 grid of spaces has digits 1-9. Click the “save” button to save your progress.
